Church bells tolled across Amish country Monday morning in memory of five young girls who were shot to death in their tiny, one-room schoolhouse one week earlier.
The Amish school where a gunman shot 10 girls last week, killing five of them, is expected to be demolished Thursday, a fire department official said.
A gunman who killed five girls and wounded five others inside a one-room Amish schoolhouse, then killed himself, had no drugs in his system, a coroner said Friday.
A new Amish schoolhouse is rising a few hundred yards (meters) from the former site of the school where a gunman lined up and shot 10 girls in October, killing five of them.
