US toy company Mattel identified a factory in China involved in producing toys which were recalled in the United States over fears they were tainted with poisonous lead, a report said Wednesday.
The world's largest toy maker Mattel, which announced a mass recall of over 18 million Chinese-made toys worldwide Tuesday, has built its decades-long reputation on its well-known Barbie dolls.
