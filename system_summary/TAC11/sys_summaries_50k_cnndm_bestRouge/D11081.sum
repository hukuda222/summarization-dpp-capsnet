A powerful cyclone packing winds of up to 240 kilometres (155 miles) an hour has hit Bangladesh's southern coast, the director of the country's meteorological department told AFP Thursday.
Thousands of people in the path of a cyclone were evacuated from coastal areas as forecasters warned the storm could hit land in Bangladesh or neighbouring India later Thursday.
The United States expressed "its deepest sympathy" for the victims of the cyclone that struck Bangladesh, offering to join international efforts to provide emergency relief.
A powerful cyclone with strong winds started pounding on Bangladesh's south and southwestern coast from Thursday evening.
