The World Health Organisation is organising a meeting next week to examine possible recommendations on male circumcision, after trials showed the practice halved the risk of HIV infection, a spokeswoman said Friday.
Early data from a trial in Uganda shows that policymakers must be prudent when including circumcision among their tactics for fighting AIDS, researchers said on Tuesday.
Heterosexual men should be circumcised because of compelling evidence that the operation can reduce their chances of contracting HIV by up to 60 percent, U.N. health agencies said Wednesday.
"Male circumcision does not provide complete protection against HIV."
